Contact Manager has been developed **with a lot of attention to its performances so that it doesn't slow down your website** and it remains fast.Moreover, contrary to a common practice among WordPress plugins/themes, **Contact Manager doesn't add any CSS or JavaScript files to the pages of your website**, in order to not increase their weights or the number of HTTP requests. So even after installing this plugin, **your website's pages will still load as quickly as before, and their Google PageSpeed scores will not drop**.== Installation ==You can install Contact Manager through the "Add Plugins" page of the "Plugins" menu in WordPress (Plugins => Add New => Upload Plugin).
